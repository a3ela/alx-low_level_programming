# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays, and strings

Welcome to the `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings` directory! In this section, we explore pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. These concepts are essential for understanding memory management, data manipulation, and string handling.

## Tasks Overview
Here's a detailed explanation of the tasks in this directory:

1. **0-reset_to_98.c**:
   - Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
   - Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`

2. **1-swap.c**:
   - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
   - Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

3. **2-strlen.c**:
   - Write a function that returns the length of a string.
   - Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`

4. **3-puts.c**:
   - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a newline, to stdout.
   - Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);`

5. **4-print_rev.c**:
   - Write a function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);`

6. **5-rev_string.c**:
   - Write a function that reverses a string.
   - Prototype: `void rev_string(char *s);`

7. **6-puts2.c**:
   - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void puts2(char *str);`

8. **7-puts_half.c**:
   - Write a function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void puts_half(char *str);`

9. **8-print_array.c**:
   - Write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n);`

10. **9-strcpy.c**:
    - Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
    - Prototype: `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`
