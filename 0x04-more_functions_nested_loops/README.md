# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

Welcome to the `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops` directory! In this section, we dive deeper into functions and nested loops in the C programming language. These concepts are fundamental for building more complex programs and solving real-world problems.

## Tasks Overview
Here's a detailed explanation of the tasks in this directory:

1. **0-isupper.c**:
   - Write a function that checks if a character is uppercase.
   - Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
   - Returns 1 if `c` is uppercase, 0 otherwise.

2. **1-isdigit.c**:
   - Write a function that checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9).
   - Prototype: `int _isdigit(int c);`
   - Returns 1 if `c` is a digit, 0 otherwise.

3. **2-mul.c**:
   - Write a function that multiplies two integers.
   - Prototype: `int mul(int a, int b);`
   - Returns the result of the multiplication.

4. **3-print_numbers.c**:
   - Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void print_numbers(void);`

5. **4-print_most_numbers.c**:
   - Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4), followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`

6. **5-more_numbers.c**:
   - Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times, followed by a newline.
   - Prototype: `void more_numbers(void);`

7. **6-print_line.c**:
   - Write a function that draws a straight line using the character `_`.
   - Prototype: `void print_line(int n);`
   - The parameter `n` represents the number of times the character `_` should be printed.

8. **7-print_diagonal.c**:
   - Write a function that draws a diagonal line using the character `\`.
   - Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n);`
   - The parameter `n` represents the number of times the character `\` should be printed.

9. **8-print_square.c**:
   - Write a function that prints a square of a given size using the character `#`.
   - Prototype: `void print_square(int size);`
   - The parameter `size` represents the size of the square.

10. **9-fizz_buzz.c**:
    - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
    - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    - For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
    - Otherwise, print the number itself.
