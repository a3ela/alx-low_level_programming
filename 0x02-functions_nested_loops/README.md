# 0x02-functions_nested_loops

Welcome to the `0x02-functions_nested_loops` directory! In this section, we explore the basics of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. 
These fundamental concepts are essential for building more complex programs.

## Introduction
Nested loops involve using one loop inside another loop. They allow us to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In this project, we'll cover various functions and loops to enhance our understanding of low-level programming.

## Files
Here's a brief overview of the files in this directory:

1. `0-putchar.c`: A program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
2. `1-alphabet.c`: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: A function that prints the alphabet ten times, each followed by a new line.
4. `3-islower.c`: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
5. `4-isalpha.c`: A function that checks if a character is an alphabetic character.
6. `5-sign.c`: A function that prints the sign of a number.
7. `6-abs.c`: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. `7-print_last_digit.c`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
9. `8-24_hours.c`: A function that prints every minute of the day (00:00 to 23:59).
10. `10-add.c`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. `11-print_to_98.c`: A function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.

## Advanced Tasks
In addition to the basic tasks, we also have some advanced ones:

1. `100-times_table.c`: A function that prints the multiplication table for a given number (up to 15).
2. `101-natural.c`: A program that computes and prints the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
3. `102-fibonacci.c`: A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
4. `103-fibonacci.c`: A program that finds and prints the sum of even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence below 4,000,000.
5. `104-fibonacci.c`: A program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.
