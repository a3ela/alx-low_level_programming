# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository contains a collection of C programs and exercises that I wrote as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming track. The goal of these programs is to help students learn about low-level programming concepts, such as data structures, algorithms, and Linux/Unix system programming.

The programs are organized into the following categories:

* **0x00. C - Hello, World:** This category contains a simple "Hello, World" program in C.
* **0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while:** This category contains programs that cover the basics of the C language, such as variables, conditional statements, and loops.
* **0x02. C - Functions, nested loops:** This category contains programs that cover functions and nested loops.
* **0x03. C - Debugging:** This category contains programs that cover debugging techniques.
* **0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops:** This category contains more programs on functions and nested loops.
* **0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings:** This category contains programs that cover pointers, arrays, and strings.
* **0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings:** This category contains more programs on pointers, arrays, and strings.
* **0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings:** This category contains even more programs on pointers, arrays, and strings.
* **0x08. C - Recursion:** This category contains programs that cover recursion.
* **0x09. C - Static libraries:** This category contains programs that cover static libraries.
* **0x0A. C - argc, argv:** This category contains programs that cover the `argc` and `argv` command-line arguments.
* **0x0B. C - malloc, free:** This category contains programs that cover the `malloc()` and `free()` functions for dynamic memory allocation.
* **0x0C. C - More malloc, free:** This category contains more programs on dynamic memory allocation.
* **0x0D. C - Preprocessor:** This category contains programs that cover the C preprocessor.
* **0x0E. C - Structures, typedef:** This category contains programs that cover C structures and the `typedef` keyword.
* **0x0F. C - Function pointers:** This category contains programs that cover function pointers.
* **0x10. C - Variadic functions:** This category contains programs that cover variadic functions.
* **0x11. C - printf:** This category contains programs that cover the `printf()` function for formatted output.
* **0x12. C - Singly linked lists:** This category contains programs that cover singly linked lists.
