# 0x03-debugging

Welcome to the `0x03-debugging` directory! In this section, we explore the art of debugging in C programming. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors (bugs) in your code. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you'll learn how to use debugging tools such as `gdb` or built-in tools that IDEs provide.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

1. **What is Debugging?**: Understand the purpose and importance of debugging in software development.
2. **Manual Debugging Methods**: Learn various manual debugging techniques, such as reading error messages and analyzing code.
3. **Fixing Infinite Loops**: Practice identifying and fixing infinite loops in your programs.
4. **Correcting Logic Errors**: Improve your skills in identifying and correcting logical errors in code.
5. **Handling Leap Years**: Fix issues related to calculating leap years in date-related functions.

## Tasks Overview
Here's a brief overview of the tasks in this directory:

1. **0-main.c, main.h**:
   - Based on the provided `main.c` file, create a file named `0-main.c`.
   - Test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
   - You are not coding the solution/function; you're just testing it.
   - You can adapt your function from `0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0` to compile with this main file for local testing.
   - Upload only `0-main.c` and `main.h` for this task.

2. **1-main.c**:
   - Comment out (don't delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
   - You are only allowed to comment out existing code; do not add or remove any lines.
   - Compilation with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` is not required for this task.

3. **2-largest_number.c**:
   - Fix the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, regardless of the case.
   - Line count will not be checked for this task.

4. **3-print_remaining_days.c**:
   - Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
   - You can assume that all test cases have valid months and days.
   - Valid month/day combinations are assumed, but not all month/day/year combinations are valid.
   - Leap years must be handled correctly.

## Requirements
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Ensure that all your files end with a new line.
- Follow the Betty style for code formatting.
